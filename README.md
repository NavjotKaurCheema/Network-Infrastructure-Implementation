# Network Infrastructure Implementation

This project involves setting up and configuring a complete network infrastructure with optimal functionality, including routing, switching, server hosting, DNS, Email Server integration, and VPN security.

## Key Features

- **Router and Switch Configuration:** Configured routers, switches, and servers for optimal functionality to ensure reliable network performance.
- **Website Hosting:** Locally hosted multiple websites within the Cisco Packet Tracer environment and implemented DNS for domain name resolution
- **Email Server Integration:** Integrated an email server to enable secure communication between users in the network.
- **VPN Security:** Secured communication with a VPN tunnel between routers to ensure secure and private data transmission.

## Technologies Used

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: For network simulation and device configuration.
- **Router & Switch Configuration**: Configured routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, EIGRP) and VLANs.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Configured DNS for resolving domain names to IP addresses.
- **Email Server**: Integrated email functionality on the network for communication.
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**: Set up a VPN tunnel between routers for encrypted communication.

## Getting Started

1. **Download Cisco Packet Tracer Student 6.2 Version** (if you havenâ€™t already)

2. **Open the Project**:
   - Download the `.pkt` file from this repository.
   - Open the `.pkt` file using **Cisco Packet Tracer** to view the network topology and configurations.

3. **Review Configurations**:
   - Check the configurations for routers, switches, DNS server, and email server.
   - Review the VPN tunnel settings to ensure secure communication between the routers.

## How to Use

1. Once the **.pkt file** is opened in **Cisco Packet Tracer Student 6.2 Version**, simulate the network and verify the functionality of:
   - DNS resolution by accessing the hosted websites.
   - Email communication between devices on the network.
   - VPN tunnel functionality for secure communication between routers.

2. Customize the configurations or add new devices as needed.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates essential network infrastructure concepts including routing, switching, server configuration, and security. The implementation of DNS, email servers, and VPN ensures a secure, efficient, and well-structured network for hosting websites and facilitating communication.
